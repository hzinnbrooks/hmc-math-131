Define a successor function \\(S: \\N \\to \\N\\), with the following requirements:\n\n\\(S(x) \\neq 1\\) for all \\(x \\in \\N.\\)\nIf \\(S(x) = S(y)\\) then \\(x=y\\) for all \\(x, y \\in \\N.\\)\nLet \\(A\\) be any subset of \\(\\N\\) which contains 1 and is closed under \\(S\\), so \\(S(x) \\in A\\) for all \\(x\\in A.\\)\n\nThen \\(A = \\N.\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe definition boils down to two ideas: there is a first element (1), and every element in the set has a successor in the set that is not 1. So, we can see that proof by induction is based on axiomatic properties of \\(\\N\\). You can start \\(\\N\\) with zero instead of 1.

If our goal is to show that \\(P(n)\\) is true for all \\(n\\), this is equivalent to showing that \\(S=\\N.\\) To do this, we must show:\n\n\\(P(1)\\) is true.

The goal is either to construct a bijection, or prove that there is no bijection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 1 Every infinite subset of a countable set is countable.\n\n\nProof. Suppose \\(A\\) is a countable set. Because \\(A\\) is countable, there is a bijection between \\(A\\) and \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), and we can label the elements of \\(A\\) as a sequence indexed by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\): \\(A = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots\\}.\\)\nNow consider \\(E \\subset A.\\) By the well-ordering property of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) there is an element of \\(E\\) with the smallest index. Call this index \\(n_1.\\) Proceeding in this manner, if we have labeled the \\(k-1\\) smallest indices as \\(\\{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_{k-1}\\},\\) then what remains unlabeled is still indexed by a subset of \\(N\\) and there is an element with the smallest index that we may call \\(n_k.\\)\nTo be more explicit about the notation here , we know that the elements of \\(E\\) are indexed by a subset of \\(N\\) that we have labeled \\(\\{n_1, n_2, ...\\}\\), so we can write \\[ E = \\{x_{n_1}, x_{n_2}, x_{n_3}, \\dots \\} \\,. \\]\nThis process creates the bijection \\(f(k) = x_{n_k}\\) between \\(E\\) and \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), and we can conclude \\(E\\) is countable. \\(\\square\\)\n\n\n\n\nThis theorem might be surprising to you: intuitively it might feel like a proper subset should be a “smaller” set and contain fewer elements. With finite sets, this is true … but infinity is different! In our quest to construct a “bigger” infinite set than \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we might try to combine countably many countable sets, but the next theorem shows that such a set would still be countable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2 (Hilbert’s Hotel) The union of a countable set of countable sets is countable.\n\n\nProof. Let \\(S\\) be a countable set of countable sets. Because \\(S\\) is countable, we can write this set as a sequence of the countable sets it contains: \\(E = \\{E_1, E_2, \\dots \\},\\) or equivalently,\n\\[\nS = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty E_n \\,.\n\\]\nRemember, each \\(E_n\\) is itself a countable set. We can denote \\(E_1 = \\{ x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{13}, \\dots\\}\\), and so on. We can use this notation to write all of the elements of \\(S\\) in an infinite array\n\\[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\nx_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & \\dots \\\\\nx_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} & \\dots \\\\\nx_{31} & x_{32} & x_{33} & \\dots \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{array}\\]\nso that the \\(n\\)th row contains the elements of the \\(n\\)th set in \\(S\\). We can use this array to create a bijection between \\(S\\) and \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) by following along the diagonals of our array: \\[\\begin{align}\nx_{11} &\\mapsto 1 \\\\\nx_{21} &\\mapsto 2 \\\\\nx_{12} &\\mapsto 3 \\\\\nx_{31} &\\mapsto 4 \\\\\nx_{22} &\\mapsto 5 \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{align}\\] It remains to convince ourselves that this is, in fact, a bijection: every element in our array is assigned to one (and only one) natural number.  Having constructed this bijection, we can see that the set \\(S = \\{x_{11}, x_{21}, x_{12}, \\dots \\}\\) of countable sets is countable. \\(\\square\\)\n\n\n\n\nWriting down this bijection explicitly can be surprisingly tricky!An application of this theorem allows us to see that even the rational numbers are countable! This means we can use the ‘Hilbert’s Hotel’ method to create a bijection between the rational numbers and the natural numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class activity\n\n\n\nProve that the rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are countable.\n\n\nAt this point, it might start to feel like all infinite sets are countable and therefore the ``same size.’’ Is this true?

That is, \\(A\\) is not in one-to-one correspondence with its power set \\(P(A),\\) and cardinality \\(A <\\) cardinality \\(P(A)\\).\n\n\nProof. Note that the function \\(f: A \\to P(A)\\) with \\(f(x)=x\\) is injective, thus confirming the existence of an injective function between a set and its power set.\nNow, it remains to show that any function \\(g:A \\to P(A)\\) is not surjective.\nFor contradiction, suppose that \\(g\\) is surjective. We construct a set \\(B = \\{x \\in A: x \\notin g(x)\\},\\) in other words, \\(B\\) is the set of all elements of \\(A\\) whose images do not include themselves. This set is a subset of \\(A\\), and thus is in \\(P(A).\\) From this, we can conclude two things:\n\nBy the definition of \\(B\\), an element \\(y \\in B\\) if and only if \\(y \\notin g(y).\\)\nSince \\(g\\) is surjective, then \\(g(y) = B\\) for some \\(y \\in A.\\) This element \\(y \\in B\\) if and only if \\(y \\in g(y).\\)\n\nHere we have a contradiction, and so we conclude that \\(g\\) cannot be surjective. \\(\\square\\)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the surjective portion of the previous proof presented here is a slick way of writing a diagonalization argument: we constructed a set \\(B \\in P(A)\\) which is not the output of any surjective function \\(f\\).\nThis theorem tells us that there is a ``bigger” set than \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), which is \\(P(\\mathbb{R})\\). This theorem has an even more delightful consequence: there is no biggest set, and it is not possible to construct a set of all sets. If it were, then the set of all sets would have to contain its own power set, but we have just shown that the power set of the set of all sets would have to be bigger.\nSo, we now know that there are infinitely-many sizes of infinities, with \\[\n\\text{ cardinality }\\mathbb{N}< \\text{ cardinality }\\mathbb{R}< \\text{ cardinality }P(\\mathbb{R}) < \\dots,\n\\] but is there a size of infinity between \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 5 (Continuum hypothesis (Cantor)) There is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.\n\n\n\n\nThe continuum hypothesis is undecidable: Gödel proved that there was no way to disprove the continuum hypothesis (1940), and Cohen showed that is was also impossible to prove it (1963). This means that one can either accept or reject the continuum hypothesis and no logical contradictions will arise in either case."
