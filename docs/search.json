I’ll work with you.\n\n\n\nThe Honor Code\nThe HMC Honor Code applies in all matters of conduct concerning this course. It is forbidden to use course solutions or materials provided by previous students, found online, or through any third party source. The struggle and joy of discovering a solution is an important part of this course. Homework sets are meant to help you practice and learn. If you resort to using solutions you find, as opposed to challenging yourself to develop your own solutions, you are doing yourself a disservice (and you won’t do as well on exams).\n\n\nExternal resources for homeworks: what’s OK, what’s not OK\nThe teaching team is well aware of the plethora of tools and solutions that are available to you, both online or within our student community. We want to be clear about what is OK and not OK with regards to these resources.\nWhat’s OK\n\nI encourage you first and foremost to talk to the Prof, the grutors, and/or each other!\nCooperation on all homework assignments is encouraged. It is appropriate to acknowledge the assistance of others; if you work with others on a homework question, please cite them as collaborators on your Overleaf submission. You should understand your solutions well enough to write them up yourself.\nFeel free to consult sources beyond your textbook and class notes when formulating your homework solutions.\n\nIt is crucial that you cite any and every external source you access (including other textbooks, any online resources, solution keys, collaborators, etc.)\nWhat’s Not OK\n\nUsing complete versions solutions found online, including accessing these solutions via sites such as Chegg. Please note that I know there are easy to find solutions online to almost all of the problems in our textbook.\nUsing solutions from previous or current students as your own work. Copying is prohibited, and you should understand your solutions well enough to write them up yourself.\nUsing solutions from ChatGPT or other generative language models as your own work. This is equivalent to copying as in the previous two bullet points.\nUploading your solutions to sites such as Chegg or providing your solutions for others to copy.\n\nThese will be regarded as a violation of the HMC Honor Code and will be handled accordingly."

    "text": "Grading and Assessment\nThe coursework that you do in Math 131 contributes to your overall course grade, which we will use to ultimately assign you a letter grade. Your overall course grade will be calculated as follows:\n\n20% homework assignments \n5% project\n20% midterm exam 1\n20% midterm exam 2\n20% final exam\nThe highest exam score of midterm 1, midterm 2, or final will contribute an additional 15%\n\nGrades will be assigned on a straight scale based on your overall percentage as calculated above. I commit to honor the following minimum cutoffs:\n\n94% or higher guarantees an A,\n84% or higher guarantees (at least) a B,\n74% or higher guarantees (at least) a C,\n64% or higher guarantees (at least) a D.\n\nRemember that your grade in this course (and any other course, for that matter) is only a measurement of your learning at one moment in time. It is never a measure of your potential ability or your worth!\n\nHomework\nHomework assignments serve several important purposes, including to further familiarize you with the course material, practice mathematical techniques, provide challenges in creative problem solving, and improve your mathematical writing skills and style. \nHomework will be assigned most weeks. Assignments will be submitted directly to Gradescope.  Using Gradescope: If you are registered for this course, you should have already been added to the Gradescope class page. Contact your instructor if you are having problems with access. Gradescope has several tutorial resources, e.g. Gradescope video tutorials.  See the document Gradescope Instructions for Students for an overview of how to submit your homework sets.\nLaTeX is an important part of written mathematical communication, and one aim of this course is for students to gain comfort and confidence in LaTeX. To this end, homework assignments must be typed in LaTeX. A LaTeX template will be provided for each homework assignment.\nDue dates and LaTeX template links can be found under the “Assignments” page on this site.\n\n\nHomework Grading Policies\nYour overall homework grade will be the mean of all of your homework scores. \nLate submission policy: Each student is granted three late assignments over the semester, no questions asked. Late submissions should be submitted within 72 hours.  When submitting work late, you must upload it electronically to Gradescope, which will automatically track the late hours. You do not need to email the professor when using these grace hours.\nIf you require extensions for extenuating circumstances (e.g., prolonged illness or family emergency), you should contact the DSA staff and I will work in consultation with DSA to make a plan for your situation. \n\n\nExams\nExams are an opportunity for you to review and synthesize your learning, demonstrate your proficiency with the material, and assess your progress. Further information about exams is forthcoming.\n\nMidterm 1: TBA\nMidterm 2: TBA\nFinal: TBA\n\n\n\nProject\nFurther information about the project is forthcoming."

    "text": "Mathematical Writing\nImproving our mathematical writing is a primary objective of this course. At HMC, this means that the skills you learned in Writ 1 are critical in Math 131!\nProof writing can seem really daunting. Sometimes it can feel like there is a “right” or “wrong” way to proceed, and that you need to demonstrate rigor in a particular way. This is not the case, and my hope for you is that this course helps you break free from this limiting belief.\nWhile there are general principles that make a proof “good,” the wonderful thing about proof writing is that there is never only one right way to construct a proof. The proof is as unique as the person who writes it. Developing your own personal mathematical style is all part of the fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Heather’s opinion on proofs\n\n\n\nThe purpose of a proof is to illuminate a mathematical truth (the theorem, lemma, or corollary). It’s an explanation of why something is true that gives us additional insight or appreciation. A good proof achieves these goals in a way that is clear, concise, and enjoyable to read.\n\n\nHow do we write a good proof? First and foremost, good mathematical writing follows the principles of good writing.\n\nConsider your audience. The level of detail that you include, the notation and terminology that you use, and the formality or informality of your language should depend on who your intended reader is. A good rule of thumb for this course is that you write your proofs so that they would be clear and understandable to yourself two weeks prior (or a few weeks from now when you’re studying for an exam).\nBe clear and concise. In my experience, it is much more common for new proof-writers to make their proofs too long rather than too short. Try to make your arguments in a direct way and do not include extraneous information.\nUse active voice. It is tempting to hide behind passive voice to make our writing sound more “objective,” but the opposite is true: using active voice is an excellent way to make your writing direct and clear. Furthermore, active voice highlights that there is a person (or people) doing the mathematics. This is empowering for you as a mathematician and it helps us all remember that mathematics is a human enterprise.\n\nRevise, revise, revise! Writing a good proof is a process … nobody writes a good proof the first time! As with any writing, proofs should have multiple drafts. You can and should edit and solicit feedback.\n\nIn mathematics, we often use “we” as the subject even if we are writing the proof by ourselves. It might sound funny at first, but this is a way to acknowledge that the proof is a shared experience between the writer and the reader.My colleague Francis Su has written some excellent guidelines for good mathematical writing that dive further into these points. Please read this handout before proceeding on any of your written assignments.\nThis study by Inglis and Aberdein suggests that appraisal of whether a proof is “beautiful,” “intricate,” “rigorous,” or even “useful” is subjective. We will spend a lot of time in class constructing and critiquing proofs. It’s possible that you, your classmates, and I will sometimes disagree on points of style. This is totally normal and it’s all part of the process."

    "text": "Review: Sets and Relations\nThe foundational mathematical objects we’ll be working with in this course are sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Set) A set is a collection of things.\n\n\n\n\nIf we are writing out a description of a set, we denote the set with curly braces. For convenience we sometimes give sets shorthand names like \\(S\\). A set is very general and can contain any type of object … even other sets!\nExample. \\(S = \\{4, \\Delta, \\Pi, \\{2, \\square\\}\\}\\) is a set, and it contains the set \\(\\{2, \\square\\}\\).\nThe set in this example contains 4 objects, which we call elements.\nWe can also write \\(S = \\{x : P(x) \\text{ is true}\\}\\), where \\(P\\) is some statement about \\(x\\). The colon (:) should be read as “such that.” \\(S\\) is the set of elements \\(x\\) such that the statement \\(P(x)\\) is true. We can also use a vertical bar (|) to denote the same idea.\nExample. S = {x : x<2}\nBelow is some helpful shorthand notation for sets that we’ll encounter a lot in this class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\in S\\)\n\\(x\\) is in \\(S\\)\n\n\n\\(x \\notin S\\)\n\\(x\\) is not in \\(S\\)\n\n\n\\(\\emptyset\\)\nThe empty set (the set with no elements)\n\n\n\\(A \\subset B\\)\n\\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\): if \\(x \\in A\\), then \\(x \\in B.\\) Be careful … \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) could be the same set!\n\n\n\\(A \\subseteq B\\)\nEquivalent to \\(A \\subset B\\), but clearly denoting the possibility of equality of the sets.\n\n\n\\(A \\not\\subset B\\)\n\\(A\\) is not a subset of \\(B\\)\n\n\n\\(A \\cup B\\)\nUnion: The set \\(\\{x:x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(A \\cap B\\)\nIntersection: The set \\(\\{x:x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(A^C\\)\nComplement: The set \\(\\{x: x \\notin A\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(A \\setminus B\\)\nSet minus: The set \\(\\{x:x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\notin B\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(A \\times B\\)\nCartesian product: The set \\(\\{(a,b): a \\in A \\text{ and } b \\in B\\}\\). Here \\((a,b)\\) is an ordered pair, so order matters.\n\n\n\nIn this course, we’ll often find ourselves in the situation where we would like to show that two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same set. Set inclusion gives us a technique to do this. If \\(A \\subset B\\) and \\(B \\subset A\\), then it must be true that every element in \\(A\\) is an element of \\(B\\) and vice versa, that is, \\(A=B.\\) Otherwise, \\(A\\neq B.\\)\nIf \\(A \\subset B\\) but \\(B \\not\\subset A\\), we say that \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(B.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 2 (Relation) A (binary) relation \\(R\\) is a subset of another object, say \\(A\\times B\\), where if \\((a,b) \\in R\\) we write \\(aRb.\\)\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nIf \\(P\\) is the set of people, then \\(A\\) “is a student of” is a relation on \\(P\\times P.\\) In the notation above: \\[\n\\text{(you)} \\,A\\, \\text{(Prof. Heather)}.\n\\]\nIf \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is the set of integers, then \\(<\\) is a relation on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\times \\mathbb{Z}.\\) In the notation above: \\[\n7 < 10.\n\\]\n\nOne important and useful type of relation is an equivalence relation, which satisfies some special properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Equivalence relation) An equivalence relation \\(R\\) on a set \\(S\\) is a relation on \\(S\\times S\\) such that\n\n\\(aRa\\) (\\(R\\) is reflexive)\n\\(aRb\\) implies \\(bRa\\) (\\(R\\) is symmetric)\nIf \\(aRb\\) and \\(bRc\\), then \\(aRc\\) (\\(R\\) is transitive)\n\n\n\n\n\nEquivalence relations are often denoted with \\(\\sim\\) or \\(\\simeq\\) (we usually reserve \\(=\\) for the identity). Possible project: Construction of the rationals \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) starting with the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) using sets and relations."

Suppose \\(A\\) is a countable set. Because \\(A\\) is countable, there is a bijection between \\(A\\) and \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), and we can label the elements of \\(A\\) as a sequence indexed by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\): \\(A = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots\\}.\\)\nNow consider \\(E \\subset A.\\) By the well-ordering property of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) there is an element of \\(E\\) with the smallest index.

With finite sets, this is true … but infinity is different! In our quest to construct a “bigger” infinite set than \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we might try to combine countably many countable sets, but the next theorem shows that such a set would still be countable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2 (Hilbert’s Hotel) The union of a countable set of countable sets is countable.\n\n\nProof. Let \\(S\\) be a countable set of countable sets. Because \\(S\\) is countable, we can write this set as a sequence of the countable sets it contains: \\(E = \\{E_1, E_2, \\dots \\},\\) or equivalently,\n\\[\nS = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty E_n \\,.\n\\]\nRemember, each \\(E_n\\) is itself a countable set. We can denote \\(E_1 = \\{ x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{13}, \\dots\\}\\), and so on. We can use this notation to write all of the elements of \\(S\\) in an infinite array\n\\[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\nx_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & \\dots \\\\\nx_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} & \\dots \\\\\nx_{31} & x_{32} & x_{33} & \\dots \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{array}\\]\nso that the \\(n\\)th row contains the elements of the \\(n\\)th set in \\(S\\). We can use this array to create a bijection between \\(S\\) and \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) by following along the diagonals of our array: \\[\\begin{align}\nx_{11} &\\mapsto 1 \\\\\nx_{21} &\\mapsto 2 \\\\\nx_{12} &\\mapsto 3 \\\\\nx_{31} &\\mapsto 4 \\\\\nx_{22} &\\mapsto 5 \\\\\n\\vdots\n\\end{align}\\] It remains to convince ourselves that this is, in fact, a bijection: every element in our array is assigned to one (and only one) natural number.  Having constructed this bijection, we can see that the set \\(S = \\{x_{11}, x_{21}, x_{12}, \\dots \\}\\) of countable sets is countable. \\(\\square\\)\n\n\n\n\nWriting down this bijection explicitly can be surprisingly tricky!An application of this theorem allows us to see that even the rational numbers are countable!

This set is a subset of \\(A\\), and thus is in \\(P(A).\\) From this, we can conclude two things:\n\nBy the definition of \\(B\\), an element \\(y \\in B\\) if and only if \\(y \\notin g(y).\\)\nSince \\(g\\) is surjective, then \\(g(y) = B\\) for some \\(y \\in A.\\) This element \\(y \\in B\\) if and only if \\(y \\in g(y).\\)\n\nHere we have a contradiction, and so we conclude that \\(g\\) cannot be surjective. \\(\\square\\)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the surjective portion of the previous proof presented here is a slick way of writing a diagonalization argument: we constructed a set \\(B \\in P(A)\\) which is not the output of any surjective function \\(f\\).\nThis theorem tells us that there is a ``bigger” set than \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), which is \\(P(\\mathbb{R})\\). This theorem has an even more delightful consequence: there is no biggest set, and it is not possible to construct a set of all sets. If it were, then the set of all sets would have to contain its own power set, but we have just shown that the power set of the set of all sets would have to be bigger.\nSo, we now know that there are infinitely-many sizes of infinities, with \\[\n\\text{ cardinality }\\mathbb{N}< \\text{ cardinality }\\mathbb{R}< \\text{ cardinality }P(\\mathbb{R}) < \\dots,\n\\] but is there a size of infinity between \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 5 (Continuum hypothesis (Cantor)) There is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.\n\n\n\n\nThe continuum hypothesis is undecidable: Gödel proved that there was no way to disprove the continuum hypothesis (1940), and Cohen showed that is was also impossible to prove it (1963). This means that one can either accept or reject the continuum hypothesis and no logical contradictions will arise in either case."

It is useful to be able to talk about which points are closer to other points.
