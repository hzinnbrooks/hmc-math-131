## Introduction to metric spaces

We call sets that have a notion of distance **metric spaces**.

## Metric Space
A set $X$ is a **metric space** if there exists a **metric** $d:X \times X \to \R$ such that for all $p, q, r \in X$, the following three conditions are satisfied.

1. Nonnegativity: $d(p,q) \geq 0,$ with $d= 0$ if and only if $p=q.$
2. Symmetry: $d(p,q) = d(q,p)$.
3. Triangle Inequality: $d(p,q) \leq d(p,r) + d(r,q).$

## In-class activity
In class, we will explore some examples of sets to determine whether or not they are metric spaces.
:::

In this activity, we'll focus on common mathematical sets that you're familiar with. However, metric spaces could show up in all kinds of applications: A set of nodes in a tree graph, a set of genetic sequences, or even a set of functions with particular properties can be metric spaces if you define a metric appropriately. Can you think of possible metrics for these sets?

## Neighborhoods

Once we know we are working in a metric space, we have a way to define distances between points, which are elements in your set. It is useful to be able to talk about which points are closer to other points. If we have a metric space $X$ with metric $d(x,y)$, we can do this with the notion of a neighborhood (sometimes called an open ball).

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-neighborhood}
## Neighborhood/open ball and closed ball
A **neighborhood** of radius $r$ (or **open ball** of radius $r$) is the set $N_r(x) = \{y: d(x,y) < r \}.$ 
	
A **closed ball** is $\overline{N_r}(x) = \{y: d(x,y) \leq r \},$ that is, we also include points on the boundary.
:::
:::

The idea of a neighborhood helps us to define a topology on a set, which describes the spatial relationship between elements in the set. Two metric spaces could have the same topology but a different geometry: we'll see examples in class to illustrate this point. 

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}
## In-class activity
Illustrate and/or describe $N_r(x)$ for given metric spaces.
:::

The topics in this course give you the foundation for further study of topology or geometry, if you're interested in learning more about these ideas.

## Limit points, interior points, and isolated points

We will study three important types of points in metric spaces: limit points, interior points, and isolated points.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-limitpoint}
## Limit point
Suppose $X$ is a metric space. A point $p \in X$ is a **limit point** or **accumulation point** of $E \subset X$ if every neighborhood of $p$ contains a point $q \in E$ where $q \neq p.$
:::
:::

Informally speaking, a limit point is a point where any neighborhood of that point includes another point that is in the set. Note that our limit point itself doesn't need to be in the set; it just needs to be arbitrarily close to points in the set.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-interiorpoint}
## Interior point
Suppose $X$ is a metric space. A point $p \in X$ is an **interior point** of $E \subset X$ if there exists a neighborhood $N(p)$ such that $N \subset E.$
:::
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-isolatedpoint}
## Isolated point
Suppose $X$ is a metric space. A point $p \in X$ is an **isolated point** of $E \subset X$ if $p \in E$ and $p$ is not a limit point of $E.$
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}
## In-class activity
We will further practice parsing these definitions and their negations in class.
:::

**Example.** Consider this picture of a metric space $X$. Green points and shaded regions are included in the set $B\subset X.$ Solid lines indicate that boundary points are included; dashed lines indicate that boundary points are not included. For each of the points $a,b,c,d,e,z$ label if they are limit points, interior points, and/or isolated points. 

![](../figures/limitpoint-example.png){width=70%}

Points $b, c, z$ are not in $B,$ whereas points $a, d, e$ are.

- $a$ is an isolated point.
- $b$ is a limit point.
- $c$ is a limit point.
- $d$ is a limit point and an interior point.
- $e$ is a limit point.
- $z$ is none of these. (It needs to be in the set to be an isolated point.)

**Example.** Consider $\R$ with the Euclidean metric. Let $G = \{ \frac{1}{n}: n \in \N\}$. What are the limit points of $G$? What are the isolated points of $G$?

**0 is the only limit point of $G$.** First, we argue that zero is a limit point. If we construct a neighborhood $N_r(0)$, then we know that
