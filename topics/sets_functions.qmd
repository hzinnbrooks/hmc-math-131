## Mathematical Writing

Improving our mathematical writing is a primary objective of this course. [At HMC, this means that the skills you learned in Writ 1 are critical in Math 131!]{.aside}

Proof writing can seem really daunting. Sometimes it can feel like there is a "right" or "wrong" way to proceed, and that you need to demonstrate rigor in a particular way. This is not the case, and my hope for you is that this course helps you break free from this limiting belief.

While there are general principles that make a proof "good," the wonderful thing about proof writing is that there is *never* only one right way to construct a proof. The proof is as unique as the person who writes it. Developing your own personal mathematical style is all part of the fun.

## Prof. Heather's opinion on proofs
The purpose of a proof is to illuminate a mathematical truth (the *theorem*, *lemma*, or *corollary*). It's an explanation of why something is true that gives us additional insight or appreciation. A good proof achieves these goals in a way that is clear, concise, and enjoyable to read.
:::


How do we write a good proof? First and foremost, good mathematical writing follows the principles of good writing. 

1. **Consider your audience**. The level of detail that you include, the notation and terminology that you use, and the formality or informality of your language should depend on who your intended reader is. A good rule of thumb for this course is that you write your proofs so that they would be clear and understandable to yourself two weeks prior (or a few weeks from now when you're studying for an exam).
2. **Be clear and concise**. In my experience, it is much more common for new proof-writers to make their proofs too long rather than too short. Try to make your arguments in a direct way and do not include extraneous information.
3. **Use active voice**. It is tempting to hide behind passive voice to make our writing sound more "objective," but the opposite is true: using active voice is an excellent way to make your writing direct and clear. Furthermore, active voice highlights that there is a person (or people) doing the mathematics.[In mathematics, we often use "we" as the subject even if we are writing the proof by ourselves. It might sound funny at first, but this is a way to acknowledge that the proof is a shared experience between the writer and the reader.]{.aside} This is empowering for you as a mathematician and it helps us all remember that mathematics is a human enterprise.     
4. **Revise, revise, revise!** Writing a good proof is a process ... nobody writes a good proof the first time! As with any writing, proofs should have multiple drafts. You can and should edit and solicit feedback.

My colleague Francis Su has written some excellent [guidelines for good mathematical writing](https://math.hmc.edu/su/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/08/Guidelines-for-Good-Mathematical-Writing.pdf) that dive further into these points. Please read this handout before proceeding on any of your written assignments.

[This study](https://philarchive.org/archive/INGDIP) by Inglis and Aberdein suggests that appraisal of whether a proof is "beautiful," "intricate," "rigorous," or even "useful" is subjective. We will spend a lot of time in class constructing and critiquing proofs. It's possible that you, your classmates, and I will sometimes disagree on points of style. This is totally normal and it's all part of the process.

## Review: Sets and Relations

The foundational mathematical objects we'll be working with in this course are sets.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-set}
## Set
A **set** is a collection of things.
:::
:::

If we are writing out a description of a set, we denote the set with curly braces. For convenience we sometimes give sets shorthand names like $S$. A set is very general and can contain *any* type of object ... even other sets!

**Example.** $S = \{4, \Delta, \Pi, \{2, \square\}\}$ is a set, and it contains the set $\{2, \square\}$.

The set in this example contains 4 objects, which we call **elements**.

We can also write $S = \{x : P(x) \text{ is true}\}$, where $P$ is some statement about $x$. [The colon (:) should be read as "such that." $S$ is the set of elements $x$ such that the statement $P(x)$ is true. We can also use a vertical bar (|) to denote the same idea.]{.aside}

**Example.** S = \{x : x<2\}

Below is some helpful shorthand notation for sets that we'll encounter a lot in this class.

| Notation | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| $x \in S$ | $x$ is in $S$ |
| $x \notin S$ | $x$ is not in $S$ |
| $\emptyset$ | The empty set (the set with no elements) |
| $A \subset B$ | $A$ is a subset of $B$: if $x \in A$, then $x \in B.$ Be careful ... $A$ and $B$ could be the same set!|
| $A \subseteq B$ | Equivalent to $A \subset B$, but clearly denoting the possibility of equality of the sets.|
| $A \not\subset B$ | $A$ is not a subset of $B$ |
| $A \cup B$ | Union: The set $\{x:x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$ |
| $A \cap B$ | Intersection: The set $\{x:x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$ |
|$A^C$ | Complement: The set $\{x: x \notin A\}$ |
|$A \setminus B$ | Set minus: The set $\{x:x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}$|
|$A \times B$ | Cartesian product: The set $\{(a,b): a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$. Here $(a,b)$ is an ordered pair, so order matters.|

In this course, we'll often find ourselves in the situation where we would like to show that two sets $A$ and $B$ are the same set. Set inclusion gives us a technique to do this. If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$, then it must be true that every element in $A$ is an element of $B$ and vice versa, that is, $A=B.$ Otherwise, $A\neq B.$

If $A \subset B$ but $B \not\subset A$, we say that $A$ is a **proper subset** of $B.$

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-relation}
## Relation
A (binary) **relation** $R$ is a subset of another object, say $A\times B$, where if $(a,b) \in R$ we write $aRb.$
:::
:::

**Examples:**

- If $P$ is the set of people, then $A$ "is a student of" is a relation on $P\times P.$ In the notation above: 
$$
\text{(you)} \,A\, \text{(Prof. Heather)}.
$$
- If $\Z$ is the set of integers, then $<$ is a relation on $\Z \times \Z.$ In the notation above: 
$$
7 < 10.
$$

One important and useful type of relation is an **equivalence relation**, which satisfies some special properties.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-eqrelation}
## Equivalence relation
An **equivalence relation** $R$ on a set $S$ is a relation on $S\times S$ such that

1. $aRa$ ($R$ is *reflexive*)
2. $aRb$ implies $bRa$ ($R$ is *symmetric*)
3. If $aRb$ and $bRc$, then $aRc$ ($R$ is *transitive*)

:::
:::

Equivalence relations are often denoted with $\sim$ or $\simeq$ (we usually reserve $=$ for the identity).
[**Possible project**: Construction of the rationals $\Q$ starting with the integers $\Z$ using sets and relations.]{.aside}

## Review: Functions

A function takes elements of one set (called the **domain**) and maps them to another set (called the **codomain**) so that we get a unique output for each input. [A function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a relation such that if $a\,f\,b$ and $a\,f\,b'$ then $b=b'.$ That is, it's a special relation that assigns each $a \in A$ to a $b \in B.$]{.aside}We use the following notation for a function $f$ with domain $A$ and codomain $B$ :
$$
f: \ \begin{array}[t]{ >{\displaystyle}r >{{}}c<{{}}  >{\displaystyle}l } 
          A &\to& B \\ 
          x &\mapsto& f(x).
         \end{array}
$$

The top line gives the function's name along with the domain and codomain. Here, we use the regular arrow $\to$ (LaTeX `\to`).
The bottom line indicates what happens to individual elements: an element $x$ in $A$ is mapped to an element $f(x)$ in $B$, with the 'maps to' arrow $\mapsto$ (LaTeX `\mapsto`).

::: {#def-image}
## Image and Inverse Image
Consider a function $f:A \to B.$ Suppose $C \subseteq A$ and  $D \subseteq B.$	

- We define $f(C) = \{f(x):x \in C\}$ to be the **image** of $C$ under this mapping.
- We define $f^{-1}(D) = \{x: f(x) \in D \}$ to be the **inverse image** of $D$ under this mapping. Note that the inverse image may not be a unique $x$ for each $f(x).$
:::
:::

That is, the image a set of outputs $f(C)$ for a particular input set $C$. The inverse image is the set of inputs $f^{-1}(D)$ that yield a particular output set $D$. The image for the domain of a function is called the **range**.

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}
## Activity
Explain in your own words the difference between codomain, range, and image. When are these quantities the same? When are they different? Give examples and/or draw pictures to illustrate this.
:::

Next, we give some important terminology to describe a function $f:A\to B.$

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-surjection}
## Surjection
When $f(A) = B$, we say that $f$ is a **surjection** or that $f$ is **surjective**. Alternatively, we say that $f$ is **onto**.
:::
:::

In other words, a function is surjective is the range and the codomain are the same: it's a function whose mapping `hits' every element in the codomain as an output.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-injection}
## Injection
If $f(x) = f(y)$ implies that $x=y$, we say $f$ is an **injection** or that $f$ is **injective**. Alternatively, we say that $f$ is **one-to-one**.
:::
:::

Equivalently, $f$ is injective if the inverse image of $f(x)$ is a single point. In an injective function, each output came from a unique input.

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
::: {#def-bijection}
## Bijection
If $f$ is both one to one and onto, we say that $f$ is a **bijection** or that $f$ is **bijective**. A bijection means that the inverse of a function is also a function, and in this case we say that $A$ and $B$ are in **one-to-one correspondence**.
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}
## Activity
Give examples and/or draw pictures of functions that satisfy the following:

- surjective, but not injective
- injective, but not surjective
- neither injective nor surjective
- bijective
